Developed an **Android** application and a **Python** application that communicate via **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**.
The goal was to send commands from the Android app to a **Raspberry Pi** (running the Python app), which controlled the streetlights of a **smart city model** to monitor and optimize energy consumption.
